Development Setup
=================

For using this software you will need:

 - `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
 - `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_

Once you have these dependencies, you'll first want to build your container, which we might call `spack/spackmon`.
To do this with docker-compose


.. ::code console

    $ docker-compose build
