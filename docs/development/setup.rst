Development Setup
=================

For using this software you will need:

 - `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
 - `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_

Once you have these dependencies, you'll first want to build your container, which we might call `spack/spackmon`.
You can reference :ref:`getting_started-containers` to see how to build and
then start containers, and test basic import.
