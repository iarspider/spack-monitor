# Spack Monitoring 

Also referred to as *spackmon*

![docs/images/spackmon-triangle-text.gif](docs/images/spackmon-triangle-text.gif)

This is the build database for spack, or specifically, a monitoring database
that can be run alongside spack to collect output and error, build specs,
status codes, and other metadata around a build. It's original design will run
with docker-compose (containers), but it could also be installed and run natively
using a hosted database elsewhere, if necessary.
